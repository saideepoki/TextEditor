# TextEditor

1. `MyFrame` class:
   - It extends `JFrame` to create the main window of the text editor.
   - Contains several nested classes for handling different functionalities.

2. `CaseHandler` class:
   - Handles the conversion of selected text to lowercase or uppercase.

3. `ButtonHandler` class:
   - Handles various button actions, such as replacing all occurrences of selected text, finding text, and replacing selected text.

4. `FileHandler` class:
   - Handles file-related operations, such as loading a file into the text editor and saving the current contents of the text editor to a file.

5. `CountHandler` class:
   - Handles counting the number of words and characters in the text editor.

6. `MyKeyAdapter`, `MyMouseAdapter`, and `MyMouseMotionAdapter` classes:
   - Implement specific event listeners for keyboard and mouse interactions with the text editor.

The code also includes the initialization and configuration of various Swing components, such as `JMenuBar`, `JMenu`, `JMenuItem`, `JScrollPane`, `JLabel`, `JTextField`, `JButton`, and `JPanel`. These components are used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) of the text editor.

Overall, the code provides basic functionality for loading and saving files, modifying text (e.g., changing case, replacing text), formatting text (e.g., changing font style, size), and counting words and characters.
